# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is for those who is too lazy to make their own CRUD Web App assignment, so feel free to use this.

> I made this README easy to understand and followed by everyone, even those who didn't even know what the hell is React js.

## Overview

This app is made by following the website on the right, but I managed to make it with the latest updated modules, like React Router v6. This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) based app.

If you're interested in what React Router changes, read [this doc](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5#upgrade-to-react-router-v6).

## Requirement(s)

In order to use this app, you need this installed

- Node.js 16.16.0

How do you know you got the right version? Open Command Prompt, then write this:

```
node -v
```

You don't know how to install? Easy, go to [this](https://tecadmin.net/install-nodejs-with-nvm-on-windows/) website, read from start to finish.

## How to use

Fork then Clone this repo to use, or just download the ZIP file from Code dropdown.

After that, open the folder in VSCode, open your terminal and type this:

```
npm install
```

Done? Good, now you're ready to edit the app.

On your terminal, type this:

```
npm start
```

This will start the app in development mode, and any changes you made in the files will be automatically applied.

Remember, EVERYTHING WILL BE APPLIED. Meaning, if you break anything it will display where you broke things. Sadly they didn't tell you how to fix it, so good luck!

If you're done, don't forget to stop the app by clicking `ctrl+c` in the terminal.
